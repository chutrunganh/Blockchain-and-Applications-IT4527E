# Lab 02: Deploy a simple ERC20 token and launch a sale campaign

In this exercise, you will create your own ERC20 tokens and launch a sale campaign for the
token. Requirements:

- Make sure your token follows ERC-20

- Please name your own token with your group ID

- Token sale campaign:

    - Allow your users to buy up to 50% of the tokens from you by paying ETH to your wallet.

    - When 50% of your tokens are sold, stop allowing other users to buy

    - Set the price of your token as follows:
        - For the first 25% of your tokens, each token costs 5 ETH
        - After 25% of your tokens were sold, each token costs 10 ETH
        - After 30 days, stop the token sale campaign
