- [x] **Precision**: Added 12-decimal price display and high-precision calculations
- [x] **UI**: Enhanced with real-time updates and detailed breakdowns

## 🎬 Demo Script

### 1. Initial State Verification
```
✅ Open http://localhost:3000
✅ Connect MetaMask to localhost:8545
✅ Import test account: 0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8
✅ Check current price shows exactly: 5.000000000000000000 ETH
```

### 2. Show Price Breakdown Feature
```
✅ Click "Show Price Breakdown"
✅ Verify shows:
   - Base Price: 5.000000000000 ETH
   - ETH Balance: 100.0000 ETH
   - Time Elapsed: [small value] days
   - Daily Interest Rate: 0.00005000% per day
   - Compound Factor: 1.000000000000000000
   - Formula: BasePrice × (1 + InterestRate)^Days
```

### 3. High-Precision Cost Calculation
```
✅ Enter 0.1 tokens to buy
✅ Check estimated cost shows 10+ decimal places
✅ Formula display: 0.1 tokens × 5.000000000000000000 ETH/token
✅ Execute transaction successfully
```

### 4. Price Change Demonstration
```
✅ After transaction, click "🔄 Refresh Price"
✅ Price should remain 5.000000000000000000 ETH (< 1 hour passed)
✅ Try buying larger amount (e.g., 10 tokens)
✅ Notice price remains stable due to 1-hour threshold
```

### 5. Time-Based Price Increase (Optional)
```
For advanced demo, you can simulate time:
- Use Hardhat console to increase time
- npx hardhat console --network localhost
- await network.provider.send("evm_increaseTime", [3600]); // 1 hour
- await network.provider.send("evm_mine");
- Refresh frontend to see price increase
```

## 📊 Expected Behaviors

### Price Display:
- **Format**: 12 decimal places (e.g., 5.000000000000000000)
- **Updates**: Auto-refresh every 10 seconds
- **Changes**: Shows ↗️/↘️ indicators with percentage when price changes

### Transaction Cost:
- **Precision**: High precision calculations prevent rounding errors
- **Validation**: Checks user balance before transaction
- **Feedback**: Clear error messages if issues occur

### Price Formula:
- **Base**: Always starts at 5 ETH
- **Interest**: ETH_balance / (2 × 10^9) per day
- **Compound**: Price = 5 × (1 + rate)^days
- **Threshold**: No interest for first hour (prevents tiny fluctuations)

## 🎯 Key Demo Points to Highlight

### 1. **Problem Solved**
"The original bug caused transaction failures due to incorrect cost calculation. This is now fixed with proper BigInt precision handling."

### 2. **Improved Algorithm** 
"We now use compound interest instead of simple interest, which correctly models how interest accumulates day by day."

### 3. **Professional UI**
"The interface shows 12-decimal precision and real-time updates, making price changes clearly visible."

### 4. **Transparency**
"Users can see exactly how the price is calculated with the detailed breakdown feature."

### 5. **Accurate Economics**
"Price starts growing fast when ETH balance is high, then slows down as ETH is sold - realistic economic behavior."

## 🚀 Ready for Demo!

Your token sale system now demonstrates:
- ✅ **Dynamic Pricing** with proper compound interest
